TODO: Needs update to see all the new features

FLEETCOM refers to the organizational body in control of the fleets of the human race in 
Microsoft's Halo universe. In the Halo universe, humanity's far reaching space colonization creates an
opportunity for rebel elements to arise, causing havok in systems far from Sol. But as humans fight within their factions, an undiscovered alien menace may change human history.

Since the setting, mechanics, and assets have been more or less already defined by Microsoft's universe,
 this gives me the chance to create a mock tutorial in what would feel like a completed game. 

Tutorials are a difficult part of games and are hard to get right. The designer must consider the balance
between hand-holding and allowing player exploration. Additionally, a tutorial must also be a demo of sorts,
 allowing the player to get a feel of what the game will be about.

In the current download, the game is a demo with a tutorial part as well as a gameplay part with an early runthrough of game mechanics and features.
