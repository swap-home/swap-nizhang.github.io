FLEETCOM refers to the organizational body in control of the fleets of the human race in 
Microsoft's Halo universe. This game was made to emulate some of the hard to make choices 
in ensuring the survival of the human species against the relentless Covenant.

The game features the strategic customization of ships, battlegroup composition, coupled with fleet movement,
and of course ship to ship combat.

The main game mechanics have been cemented and a tutorial to explain how the game works is in progress.
